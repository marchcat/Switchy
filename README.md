# Switchy
Switches keyboard layout with the Caps Lock key.

Just put [Switchy.exe](https://github.com/marchcat/Switchy/releases/latest) in the startup folder (to open it press **Win+R** and type **shell:startup**).

> Note: for keyboard layout switching to work in programs running with administrator privileges, Switchy must also be run with administrator privileges. This can be automated using Task Scheduler.

Usage:
* **CapsLock** to change keyboard layout  
* **Shift+CapsLock** to toggle CapsLock state
* **Alt+CapsLock** to enable/disable Switchy
